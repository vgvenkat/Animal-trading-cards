			<p>Zebras usually eat grass and shrubs and graze more widely than any species. Zebras live in small groups called harems which mainly include a stallion who is the lead protector, foals and offsprings. The stallions are the aggressor in case of an attack by predator, foals attack when their offsprings are in danger.In most cases, zebras try to outpace their enemy.</p>
